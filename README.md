# dotfiles
Repo to store my dotfiles

Finally built a dotfiles repo. Have rolled my bashrc and aliases file into this repo.

The bashrc gets symlinked into my $HOME and then loads all the files in this repo.

## TODO:
* bash_profile
* vimrc
* ssh
* nonorc
* gitconf

I'm sure there is more but I'll feel better when crossing the above off.
